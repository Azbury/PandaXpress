This is the code for an arduino controlled over sand vehicle designed for ENES100 class in the Unversity of Maryland. The task at hand for our group is the terrain mapping mission. The main objectives are to 
1. navigate to within 250 mm of a boulder
2. measure the length of the y-axis of the boulder within 25 mm of the actual length of the boulder
3. transmit that length

Advanced missions involve 
4. measuring and transmitting the surface area of the y-z plane within 75 cm2
5. determining and transmitting the color of the boulder. 

The robot will use the code to reach its destination and take the measurements.
